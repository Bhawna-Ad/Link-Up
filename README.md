# Tunes Cafe
## Inspiration
Pandemic has been harsh on people's social lives and being cooped up in the house all day has made most of us lose connectivity with our friends and families. To overcome this feeling of being lonely, I wanted to build something that could help people to stay in contact with their acquaintances or meet new people while having some fun activities together and gain that connectivity back.

## What it does
Tunes Cafe is a place where you can hangout with your friends and families or meet completely new people and spend time together while having a lot of fun activities. It allows the users to create rooms or join the ones already created. You just have to tell the application the name of the room that you wish to join and it will take you there. Once you join the room you can watch a concert with your friends and families or have a fun karaoke session or maybe just throw a concert of your own and all this while being at home. It also provides real-time video and messaging chat facility to interact with the room members.

## How we built it
Tunes Cafe is a web application that is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the Front-End. To provide the users with real-time video chatting and messaging feature, I used WebRTC.

## Challenges we ran into
To implement real-time video chatting and texting facility was not an easy task. I had to go through a lot of resources to learn how to implement the feature and to find the best technology that can be used to achieve the working as desired. Maintaining the video quality of the video chats also took quite a lot of time and eventually I was left with lesser time for rest of the work. I also ran into a lot of issues while deploying the application but after fixing some bugs and errors I was able to make the application go live.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud that I was able to overcome all the hinderances that I came across while building the application and that the application is live now. Though I found it difficult to manage time while working with a technology that I have never used before but I am content that I could submit the project within the given deadline.

## What we learned
While working on this project I learnt how the applications that provide the messaging and video chatting facility actually work. I also learnt how WebRTC works and how to implement it into a web application. Apart from this I also learnt how important it is to manage time and plan out the things to work on while being in a hackathon.
